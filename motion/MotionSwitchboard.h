/**
 * The switchboard is literally a switching mechanism to select between the
 * different ways that we can publish joint values to the robot (called
 * MotionProviders). For example, the walk engine and the queueing system both
 * provide such functionality.
 *
 * The appropriate MotionEnactor will then take the nextJoints and pass them
 * down to the robot/simulator correctly.
