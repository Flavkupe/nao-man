/**
 *
 * This class implements the basic strucutre of an FSA to model the 
 * state transitions of a robot's leg during walking. Particularly,
 * it switches between single and double support modes.
 *
 * This class is designed to switch states automatically, without external
 * input. The only time it needs external input is when it should start
 * Stopping is handled implicitly by ceasing calls to tick(), followed
 * eventually (potentially?) by a call to startRight/startLeft
 *
 * Take note of the autonomous state switching because it will be critical
 * to make sure the dest_x, dest_y sent to this class are calculated from
 * ZMP values in sync with the state transitions of this class.
 *
 * Currently, the state transitions of this class are based on the walking
 * parameters pointer stored locally. This means that items such as step
 * length, etc are currently not variable per step. This will change eventually
 *
 * Eventually, the tick() method should probably be passed something like a
 * LocalStep, which is a step defined in the c frame. If this step has attr.
 * such as destination for the legs, duration, etc, we should be able to move
 * forward with steps of variable length, etc
